                    <h2>My Background</h2>
                    <p>
                        I started my career teaching in a school for students with learning disabilities. This experience 
                        helped me gain the ability and confidence to work with struggling students. 
                        I then moved on to have teach 1st and 2nd grade students for over 34 years. 
                        I have always felt compassion for students who are struggling to learn to read and have many skills 
                        and programs I use to help children learn to read and write.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through the years I have focused on students with learning disabilities, processing disorders, 
                        spectrum disorders and any students who struggle with reading and math. I am very familiar 
                        with IEP's 504 and other support systems in public school. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have advocated for students in the special educations system and have a knowledge of 
                        rights of students and parents according to special education laws.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Recently in order to continue to support struggling students and their families I went to
                         Graduate School to get my Educational Therapist Certification at UC Riverside.
                        This certification exposed me to various methods for understanding and managing students 
                        with language-based learning differences. I was introduced to various phonemic, reading, and 
                        writing programs to use with students. I learned to design a specific plan for the curriculum 
                        so a student can be successful in learning. These compensatory strategies can be used with a 
                        student whether individually or in the classroom. I also have experience using various 
                        assessment tools to evaluate a students' progress in reading and language arts.
